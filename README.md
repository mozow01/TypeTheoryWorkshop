## Lean4 Mathlib4

Lean4: https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html

Creating a Lean4 project: https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html 

````my_project```` is going to be your Lean4 project (within a folder say Dokumentumok/Lean, where you are in, in Terminal or "Parancssor" for win)  

````terminal
lake +leanprover/lean4:nightly-2024-04-24 new my_project math
````

Then my_project/my_project and my_project/my_project/Basic.lean is created, and you can start to programming in Lean4.
